•	Learning curves for training and testing data <br/>
•	For each class, images where the correct class probability is very high, or very low. <br/>
•	For each class, images near the decision boundary, where the probability for the correct class is slightly higher/lower than the other classes. <br/>
•	Confusion matrix, visualizing the frequency of correct classifications and mis-classifications. <br/>
